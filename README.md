## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are a few things about me:

- I am constantly working on publishing my Obsidian notes (I have been making Obsidian notes since 2017) to Quartz at this URL: https://diyaagrams.com/
- I love making diagrams (Specifically network diagrams with draw.io) and technical documentation (MarkDown documentation).
- I do not wish to live in an undocumented world ðŸ˜‰. Making changes to my home network without documenting it is a serious crime.
- I use Proxmox as my home network hypervisor and I love all the rich features.
